## MacOS Note

- Since version **v2.1.0** `GOOS=darwin` build requires `IOKit` as dependency and is only possible on Mac with cgo enabled.
- Apple M1 (darwin/arm64) is supported. (Thank to [martinhpedersen's](https://github.com/martinhpedersen) [PR](https://github.com/albenik/go-serial/pull/25))

## Package updated to v2 version

A cross-platform serial library for Go.

Forked from [github.com/bugst/go-serial](https://github.com/bugst/go-serial) and now developing independently.
